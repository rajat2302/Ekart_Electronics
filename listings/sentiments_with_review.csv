review,sentiment
I gave this as a Christmas gift to my in-laws husband and uncle. They loved it and how easy they are to use with fantastic features!,Awesome
this is my first tablet .. love it .. actually read my first e-book on it .. large screen. easy to read & play games .. fits nicely in my purse,Awesome
This is exactly what the person wanted as a gift and she enjoys using it.,Awesome
Overall a nice product for traveling purposes Value for money,Awesome
My wife bought this for me for my birthday. I enjoy reading bio-graphys which usually have color photos. The regular Kindle make the pics black and white or they're aren't any. This allows me to see the color photos. I also love the night feature when I'm in bed reading. I no longer need a light on to read or need to hold a large book.,Awesome
I love this product. It is exactly what i want.,Awesome
This is best product you can get in thi price range.,Awesome
This product is worth buying. Great deal.,Awesome
Best feature and durable product with perfect price.,Awesome
Does all basic functions of a tablet. Hardcore users may want an iPad.,Good
Not good for rough use but can work perfectly for regular use.,Good
Durability is good but price is to much.,Good
Good for entertainment but not for work,Good
Average product performance wise.,Good
Product is good but price is little high.,Good

Not so great unless you want to spending alot of money on amazon for everything. unable to download any google are android apps.,Good
Easy to use. I'm still playing around with it. Purchase it for my son.,Good
Good over all i had competitors streaming devices and none were as good as this i would recommend to buy.,Good
i Bought this around black friday for $60 hoping it would be awesome... it failed so hard i tried multiple different micro SD cards none of which were recognized and YES i formated them with every format i could think of ... Fat32/NTFS/Fat/Xfat... i even tried to have the tablet do it... didnt work... to make matters worse half the apps i wanted to use werent in the app store and i came to find out that it isnt linked to the normal google play store this tablet has its own app store which is missing many common apps... the main reason i bought this was to play clash of clans and i cant because it wasnt on the app store... i tried to also use aftermarket play stores to play COC but it didnt work... launched and played 1 time but didnt work or update after that... needless to say i returned it and bought a $250 samsung galaxy tab A 10.1 (2016 version) with S-pen and its WAYYYYY better... bottom line you get what you pay for... also hint the s-pen version has an extra 1 GB of ram over the non pen version... so you should get that if you can afford the extra $50...,Disappointing
Didn't have some of the features I was looking for. Returned it the next day. May be good for others,Disappointing
The user interface is bit difficult to use and touch screen response is not as expected.,Disappointing
It works but it takes a while to do anything.,Disappointing
I purchased this tablet for my daughter and within 5 days after purchasing it the screen went completely blank.,Disappointing
I would NOT recommend buying this product.,Disappointing
It is also very limited to apps you can download on it. Many apps wouldn't work after being installed.,Disappointing
Quality is not that good as expected.,Disappointing
stop working is multiple task are assigned,Disappointing
Got damaged product.,Disappointing
